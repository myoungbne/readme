## Hi, my name is Michelle!
### Welcome to my GitHub space. 

#### GET TO KNOW ME
I am a senior technical writer and content specialist with over 25 years of demonstrated experience across various industries, including ERP software, mining, utilities, education, renewable energy and transportation. I specialize in technical writing, content creation and management, knowledge mining, content frameworks, multi-publishing outputs (including Wikis), DevOps, and agile methods and tools. I approach all content planning and creation with logic to manage content as a single source of truth.

I help companies, open-source private projects, government agencies, educators, and technical writers (new to DevOps and open-source) navigate, understand, contextualize, manage, and create a new way for documentation. By planning and considering documentation as a single source of truth and aligning with development cycles, business processes and workflows, content becomes relevant and useful rather than, sometimes, a reactive process due to multiple factors. 

#### MY SUPERPOWERS

I can put others at ease and build rapport quickly to understand role requirements, pain points, objectives, and the best consumption method (not everyone enjoys reading text!). I also consider prior industry knowledge and role experience to integrate standard terms that can sometimes differ in meaning across companies and industries (you say tomato, I say tomatoeeee!). 

#### MY PURPOSE
My goal is simple: to create and deliver considered, accurate, and useable content that makes sense while meeting agreed-upon objectives and delivery timeframes.

#### MY INTENT
My intent is always focused on the Persona and audience. In simple terms, I start at the finish line! That means I start by understanding the objective and use case first!

#### MY SCHOOL OF THOUGHT
Documentation should be planned, created and managed carefully using simple methods, relevant tools, and concepts that make sense for the audience and intended use case.

My approach, methods, writing and content experience, knowledge, and skills, along with outstanding time management and communication skills, allow me to deliver a unique and innovative offering.

#### One where traditional technical writing skills meet modern concepts and tools.
