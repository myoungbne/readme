It's not you, it's me ...

Hey! My name is Michelle. 
Whilst I may be new to Github on the surface, I am not new to its realm (or the wee iconic black cat that has no face but somehow seems to spread so much of a message?) In fact I have been working away in the background for a while researching, reading, and finally starting to comprehend the many layers and context of this beast that is #github.com, and all that is changing and evolving in the technology space. Worthy of a mention, is my (somewhat) educated realisation of the true importance of technical writing and content, and where that fits into this new way forward.
Finally content will have a voice, and be given the focus and respect it deserves. 
Imagine a world where documentation is actually used, and... gasp, current.
Goodbye outdated technical debt and hello DevDocs documentation and processes. 
There's a new sheriff in town, and I am here for it!

ABOUT ME

I have over 17 years experience in technical writing.
I start at the finish line - I have a persona-focused and empathetic approach and take the time to understand the business, end goal and audience.
I specialise in creating content frameworks, design systems, workflows, repo structures, templates, including creating single source content. My way forward is focussed solely in the DevOps space, and to align with agile methodologies and processes.
I am passionate about accessibility and creating and publishing considerate4 content. 
Content should be available for everyone, not just the majority!
And I also happen to love everything about what I do.
My experience spans across various industries including ERP software, mining, renewable energy, government, power, utilities and most recently education.
I have been fortunate (and worked hard!) to gain incredible experience and meet and build strong relationships on that professional journey.
I can't wait to get involved with projects that are purpose driven, with good intentions. I have many purpose driven projects I am working on, and I look forward to sharing them along the way.
I have a lot to share, learn and do.
