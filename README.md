It's not you, it's me ...

Hey! My name is Michelle. 
Whilst I may be new to Github on the surface, I am not new to its realm (or the wee iconic black cat that has no face but somehow seems to spread so much of a message?) In fact I have been working away in the background for a while researching the many layers and evolving landscape of this beast that is GitHub, open source, and the changing technology space. Worthy of a mention, is my newfound realisation of the true importance of technical writing and documentation and where that fits into this new way forward.
Finally content will have a voice, and be given the focus and respect it deserves. 
Imagine a world where documentation is actually used, and... gasp, current.
Goodbye outdated technical debt and hello DevDocs and open source documentation and processes. 
There's a new sheriff in town, and I am here for it.

ABOUT ME

I have over 17 years experience in technical writing.
I start at the finish line! I have a persona-focused and empathetic approach and take the time to understand the business, project, end goal and audience first.
I specialise in creating content that is easy to understand, navigate, consume and is considerate. I love creating content, frameworks, design systems, workflows, repo structures and templates with a "single source of truth" approach. 
My way forward is focussed in the DevOps and open source space and to align with agile methodologies and processes.
I am passionate about accessibility and creating and publishing considerate content. 
Content should be available for everyone, not just the majority!

And I also happen to love everything about what I do.
My experience spans across various industries including ERP software, mining, renewable energy, government, power, utilities and most recently education.
I have been fortunate (and worked hard!) to gain incredible experience and meet and build strong relationships on that professional journey.
I can't wait to get involved with open source and projects that are purpose driven, with good intentions. 
I have many ideas that I am working on. I have a lot to share, learn and do.
