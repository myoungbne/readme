It's not you, it's me ...

Hey! My name is Michelle. 
Whilst I may be new to Github on the surface, I am not new to its realm (or the wee iconic black cat that has no face but somehow seems to spread so much of a message?) In fact I have been working away in the background for a while researching, reading, and finally starting to comprehend some of the components of this beast that is Git and everything else currently changing and evolving in the technology space. Worthy of a mention, is my somewhat educated realisation of the true importance of technical writing and content and where that fits into this new way forward.
Finally content will have a voice and be given the focus and respect it deserves. Imagine a world where documentation is actually used, and... gasp, up to date.
Goodbye outdated technical debt and hello DevDocs documentation and processes. 
There's a new sheriff in town, and I am here for it!

About me

I have over 17 years experience in technical writing.
I start at the finish line - I have a persona-focused and empathetic approach and take the time to understand the business, audience, and reader.
I specialise in creating content frameworks, design systems, workflows, repo structures, templates, including creating single source content, predominatnly in the DevOps space and to align with agile methodologies and processes.
I am passionate about accessibility and making content available for everyone, not just the majority!
And I love everything about what I do.
My experience spans across industries including ERP software, mining, renewable energy, government, power, utilities and most recently education.
I have been fortunate (and worked hard!) to gain incredible experience and meet and build strong relationships.
I can't wait to get involved with some projects that are purpose driven with good intentions. I have many that I am working on and look forward to sharing them along the way.
I have a lot to share, learn and do.
