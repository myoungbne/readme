## Hi, my name is Michelle!
### Welcome to my GitHub space. 

#### GET TO KNOW ME
I am a senior technical writer, content specialist, and fierce advocate for accessibility, big data, and open-source concepts, methods, and tools. I have earned my stripes with over 25 years of demonstrated experience and a unique blended offering. I specialize in technical writing, content creation and management, knowledge mining, content frameworks, multi-publishing options (including Wikis), DevOps, and agile methods and tools, and I approach all content planning, creation, and management as a single source of truth.

My industry experience includes ERP software, mining, utilities, education, renewable energy and transportation.

I help companies, open-source private projects, government agencies, educators, and technical writers (new to DevOps and the challenges that can exist with content, technical debt, and initial road bumps) to explore, understand, contextualize, manage, and navigate a new way for documentation and content creation and management. By planning and considering documentation as a single source of truth and aligning with development cycles and operations workflow, content can become useful and important, rather than a reactive process.

#### MY SUPERPOWERS

I can put others at ease, and quickly build a rapport to understand role requirements, any pain points, objectives, and best consumption method (not everyone enjoys reading text!). I also understand any prior industry knowledge and role experience to consider standard terms that can differ in context across companies and industries (you say tomato, I say tomatoeeee!). Ultimately delivering content that is useable and makes sense! Simple...


My focus and intent are always focussed on the Persona and audience. In simple terms, I start at the finish line and understand the intent and end-user first!

Documentation and information should be considered, allowing the audience to consume the content how they choose; CONTENT TO EMPOWER! 
My approach and methods, together with my technical writing and content experience, software and industry knowledge, outstanding time management and communication skills, and ability to think outside the box, give me a unique and innovative offering.
