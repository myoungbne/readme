Michelle is a professional Technical Writer, Content Creator, and Accessibility and Open data Advocate with unique skills and experience. She specializes in digital documentation and renovation, knowledge mining, content frameworks, DevOps continuous content, source control, tools and processes. Her industry experience includes software, education, mining, utilities, power, renewable energy and transportation.

Michelle helps companies, open-source private projects, government agencies, technical writers (new to DevOps and the challenges that can exist with content, technical debt, and road bumps that can present), and educators to explore, understand, contextualize, manage, and navigate a new way for documentation and content creation and management. By bringing documentation into the development process and operations workflow, content can become a single source of truth (SSoT) rather than an afterthought and reactive.
She has an agile and persona-focused approach with consideration to source control, content reuse (SSoT), multi-publishing options, and user needs aligning with role requirements!

Her superpower? Michelle can put others at ease and understand their needs and pain points while considering the user's prior industry knowledge and aligning standard terms that can differ in meaning across companies and industries (you say tomato, I say tomatoeeee)!

Most important to Michelle is the end-user, delivering content based on the best use case and allowing users to select how to consume the information - Content to Empower! Her approach and methods bring together the best of her experience, industry and knowledge. Add smart writing using AI and the human factor (AI + human = context), thinking outside the box, and relatable and valuable life experiences. You have a unique and innovative offering.

Michelle's knowledge, tools, guides and frameworks give documentation, content and information the stage and attention it deserves.
