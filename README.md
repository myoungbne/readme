## About me

My name is Michelle.

Whilst I may be new to Github on the surface, I am not new to its realm (or the wee iconic black cat that has no face but somehow seems to spread so much of a message?) In fact I have been working away in the background for a while researching the many layers and evolving landscape of this beast that is GitHub, open source, and the changing technology space. üè∑Ô∏èWorthy of a mention, is my newfound realisation of the true importance of technical writing and documentation and where that fits into this new way forward.
Finally content will have a voice üöÄ and be given the focus and respect it deserves. 
Imagine a world where documentation is actually used, and... gasp, current.
Goodbye outdated technical debt and hello DevDocs and open source documentation and processes. 
There's a new sheriff in town, and I am here for it.

## Experience

I have over 17 years experience in technical writing and documentation.

üöÄI start at the finish line and take the time to understand the business, project, end goal and audience first.
I  have a persona-focused and empathetic approach to all documentation and content that I author and create, with a focus on  creating content that is easy to understand, navigate, consume and is considerate. I am skilled at creating and maintaining documentation frameworks, design systems, workflows, repo structures and templates, with a "single source of truth" approach. 

My next professional chapter is focussed on DevDocs, open source and agile methodologies and processes. I am passionate about accessibility and creating and publishing considerate content. 

### Content should be accessible for everyone, not just the majority! üéâ

My industry experience includes ERP software, mining, renewable energy, education, transport, government and power and utilities. I have worked hard to earn my stripes in the technical writing world and have met and built great relationships along the way. I can't wait to get involved with open source and projects that are purpose driven, with good intentions. 

The next chapter of my story will be written in this space. My goal is to set a high standard and create the benchmark for the miniman standards of technical writing in open source projects. I want Go-To Doco to be the 'Go-To' for high quality documentation services and advice. A brand that is known for building and contributing towards a strong open source, technical writing network.

and to become the Go-To for all things related. I will achieve this

I am excited to learn, share and help build a great documentation network and brand, focussed on open source, DevDocs and technical writing. ‚ú®üï∫
