## About me 💫

Hey! My name is Michelle. 

Whilst I may be new to GitHub on the surface, I am not new to its realm (or the wee iconic black cat that has no face but somehow seems to spread so much of a message?) In fact I have been working away in the background researching the many aspects and evolving landscape of technology and the beast that is GitHub and open source. 

Worthy of a mention,🏷️ is my newfound respect for the true importance of technical writing and documentation and where that fits into this new way forward. Finally content will have a voice and be given the focus and respect it deserves. 

Imagine a world 🚀 where documentation is actually used, understood, accessible, and... gasp, up-to-date!
Goodbye outdated technical debt and hello DevDocs and open source documentation and processes. 

There's a new sheriff in town, and I am here for it. ✨🕺

## Experience 💫

I have over 17 years of demonstrated experience in technical writing and documentation.

I start at the finish line! 

What does that mean?

It means I start at the end and first take the time to understand the business, project, end goal and audience. 👪 
I have a persona-focused and empathetic approach to all documentation that I author and create, with the desire to create content that is easy to understand, navigate and consume. I am skilled at creating and maintaining documentation frameworks, design systems, workflows, repo structures and templates, with a "single source of truth" approach. 

I am passionate about accessibility and creating and publishing considerate content. 
### Content should be accessible for everyone, not just the majority! 🎉

My industry experience includes ERP software, mining, renewable energy, education, transport, government and power and utilities. I have worked hard to earn my stripes in the technical writing world and have also built great relationships along the way. I can't wait to get involved with open source and projects that are purpose driven, with good intentions. 

My new chapter is focussed on DevDocs, open-source and agile methodologies and processes, with the goal to set a high standard and create the benchmark to become the minimum standard used and referenced for technical writing and documentation in open source projects and DevDocs. 

Go-To Doco will be the 'Go-To' for quality documentation services and advice. A brand that is known for building and contributing towards a strong and supportive open source, technical writing network.

I am excited to learn, share and contribute. ✨🕺
